# servo-demo
This ```servo demo``` is part of the ![dynamixel AX 12A servo driver]([https://github.com/ddening/servo-demo](https://github.com/ddening/dynamixel-ax-12a-servo/tree/main)). The demo provides several options to interact with the connected servos, e.g. ```show connected devices```, ```set id```, ```set speed```, ```set angle``` etc. Also a pytest sample is provided, which tests several positions, speeds, limits and provides a plot over time of the measured max supported speed of a given servo.
